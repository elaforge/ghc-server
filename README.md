This is an experimental sketch.  I recall I got it working, but timing tests
didn't reveal any speed-up.  Then I got a faster computer and lost
motivation.  I didn't investigate very deeply why it didn't speed up as I
hoped.  It's possible the approach is still valid, but I made some mistake in
the implementation.

It's uploaded here in case someone wants to work on something similar and
wants to copy ideas or code.  I don't think there's any fundamental reason it
shouldn't work.

It's public domain, so copy what you wish.
